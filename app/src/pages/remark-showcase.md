This page is here to show you that you can use html inside of your remark pages you'll be able to do many things with this plugin.

Before going on to create sites I suggest you look at the ReadME file in your home directory and understand how everything works.

This page is made by  using a package called remark directives combined with another package called remark-html-directives. 

To look into it look at this site: <https://github.com/louiss0/remark-html-directives> 

:a[Astro]{.underline.underline-offset-2 href="https://astro.build" target="_blank"} is a good tool even though it's clearly still young it has everything you need to make basic static sites.

 ::a[Go Back]{.rounded-sm.bg-blue-300.py-1.px-3.justify-self-start href="/"}

   Yes what you see is a section of :abbr[HTML]{title='Hypertext Markup Language'} that you can control by using 
           :abbr[CSS]{title='Cascading Style Sheets'}
